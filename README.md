### Hi there, I'm Max ðŸ‘‹

## I'm a computer science conversion student


**MaxSkippGriff/MaxSkippGriff** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an attention-based model for the re-identification of Amur tigers
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java, Python 3 and Angular
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything which interests or excites me
- âš¡ When I'm not programming, I love running, writing and spending time with friends and family
